                    <p class="lead"> Medication non-compliance causes 125,000 annual deaths and 10% of the total hospitalizations. People with at least one chronic disease, about 125 million people in the US, are particularly vulnerable because they are already physically and mentally overwhelmed. <br>
                        <br>
                        While many devices and systems have been developed, it has been challenging to find the right balance between allowing for the individual’s autonomy and tracking. <br>
                        <br>
                        In a team of two, we designed a medication management system to save lives by decreasing cognitive load and promoting better medication intake habits.<br></p>

                            Users need a means to dismiss the reminder if they are not ready or if they do not want to take their medication at all. <br>
                            <br>
                            Users preferred to know before a text message was sent to a caregiver. Adding an additional layer of dimensionality created a higher incentive for user to take medication before a caregiver is involved. By adding verbal notification about the text also prevents caregivers from receiving messages about medical adherence misconduct multiple times per day. <br>
                            <br>
                            Observing users attempt to confirm using the QR code increased the cognitive tasks and took too much time. Thus, we pivoted from using a colored QR code to capturing and timestamping an image of the user taking their medication. An image is more significant than a binary classification because users are able to refer back and see themselves taking the medication as opposed to a binary confirmation.</p> <br> <br> <br>

                                We started with the name and images of the medicine categorized by a single color, we added the number of tablet in iteration #2. <br>
                                <br>
                                Versions #3 and #4 were dual screens which we thought would allow users to swipe back and forth between additional facts as needed. Upon testing, user behavior indicated the less layers to uncover necessary made the task easier. <br>
                                <br>
                                In the final iteration, we decided upon a single screen. The name on the prescription was included followed by a description of the purpose and the dosage in mg. Since users found the negative side effects more useful they were placed in a more salient location of the screen. over the intended purpose.
